      <h3>Upload Financials</h3>
      <strong>We need financials for the the current fiscal year and the previous year.</strong>
      <p>Financial statements must be prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and must include balance sheets, statements of comprehensive income, statements of cash flows, statements of changes in stockholdersâ€™ equity and notes to the financial statements.</p>

      <p>
       For an offering in the first 120 days of a fiscal year, financials may be for the two fiscal years prior to the most recently completed year (unless they are already available). If more than 120 days have passed since the end of the fiscal year, the financials must be for the two most recently completed fiscal years.</p>

       <strong>An independent CPA review is needed for raises over $100k</strong>
       <p>Since your max offering funding amount is over $100k, Financial statements must be reviewed by a public accountant that is independent of the issuer and must include a signed review report.</p>
       <p>
        The public accountant that audits or reviews the financial statements provided by an issuer must be (1) duly registered and in good standing as a certified public accountant under the laws of the place of his or her residence or principal office or (2) in good standing and entitled to practice as a public accountant under the laws of his or her place of residence or principal office.
