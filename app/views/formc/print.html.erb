        This Form C and any documents incorporated by reference herein or therein contain forward-looking statements and are subject to risks and uncertainties. All statements other than statements of historical fact or relating to present facts or current conditions included in this Form C are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements give the Company’s current reasonable expectations and projections relating to its financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and business. You can identify forward-looking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. These statements may include words such as "anticipate," "estimate," "expect," "project," "plan," "intend," "believe," "may," "should," "can have," "likely" and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of the timing or nature of future operating or financial performance or other events.

    <div class=' formc_margin30 formc-row'>
        The forward-looking statements contained in this Form C and any documents incorporated by reference herein or therein are based on reasonable assumptions the Company has made in light of its industry experience, perceptions of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors it believes are appropriate under the circumstances. As you read and consider this Form C, you should understand that these statements are not guarantees of performance or results. They involve risks, uncertainties (many of which are beyond the Company’s control) and assumptions. Although the Company believes that these forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, you should be aware that many factors could affect its actual operating and financial performance and cause its performance to differ materially from the performance anticipated in the forward-looking statements. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should any of these assumptions prove incorrect or change, the Company’s actual operating and financial performance may vary in material respects from the performance projected in these forward- looking statements.

        Any forward-looking statement made by the Company in this Form C or any documents incorporated by reference herein or therein speaks only as of the date of this Form C. Factors or events that could cause our actual operating and financial performance to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for the Company to predict all of them.

        <strong>RISK FACTORS</strong>
    </div>
    <div class=' formc_margin30 '>
        <strong>Risks Related to the Company’s Business and Industry</strong>
    </div>
    <div class='formc_margin30 bold_and_italic'>
        To date, we have not generated revenue, do not foresee generating any revenue in the near future and therefore rely on external financing.
    </div>
    <div class=' formc_margin30 formc-row'>
        We are a startup company and our business model currently focuses on <span style='background-color: yellow'> [fill in focus and cash requirements]</span> rather than generating revenue. While we intend to generate revenue in the future, we cannot assure you when or if we will be able to do so.
    </div>

    <div class=' formc_margin30 formc-row'>
        We rely on external financing to fund our operations. We anticipate, based on our current proposed plans and assumptions relating to our operations (including the timetable of, and costs associated with, new product development) that, if the Minimum Amount is raised in this Offering, it will be sufficient to satisfy our contemplated cash requirements through approximately <span style='background-color: yellow'> [fill in </span> , assuming that we do not accelerate the development of other opportunities available to us, engage in an extraordinary transaction or otherwise face unexpected events, costs or contingencies, any of which could affect our cash requirements.
    </div>

    <div class=' formc_margin30 formc-row'>
        We expect capital outlays and operating expenditures to increase over the next several years as we expand our infrastructure, commercial operations, development activities and establish offices.
    </div>

    <div class=' formc_margin30 formc-row'>
        Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including but not limited to the following:
    </div>
    <div class=' formc_margin30 formc-row'>
        *  The cost of expanding our operations;<br>
        *   The financial terms and timing of any collaborations, licensing or other arrangements into which we may enter;<br>
        *  The rate of progress and cost of development activities;<br>
        *  The need to respond to technological changes and increased competition;<br>
        *    The costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights;<br>
        *   The cost and delays in product development that may result from changes in regulatory requirements applicable to our products;<br>
        *  Sales and marketing efforts to bring these new product candidates to market;<br>
        *   Unforeseen difficulties in establishing and maintaining an effective sales and distribution network; and<br>
        *  Lack of demand for and market acceptance of our products and technologies.<br>
    </div>

    <div class=' formc_margin30 formc-row'>
        We may have difficulty obtaining additional funding and we cannot assure you that additional capital will be available to us when needed, if at all, or if available, will be obtained on terms acceptable to us. If we raise additional funds by issuing additional debt securities, such debt instruments may provide for rights, preferences or privileges senior to the Securities. In addition, the terms of the debt securities issued could impose significant restrictions on our operations. If we raise additional funds through collaborations and licensing arrangements, we might be required to relinquish significant rights to our technologies or product candidates, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. If adequate funds are not available, we may have to delay, scale back, or eliminate some of our operations or our research development and commercialization activities. Under these circumstances, if the Company is unable to acquire additional capital or is required to raise it on terms that are less satisfactory than desired, it may have a material adverse effect on its financial condition.

        We have [no] [a limited] operating history upon which you can evaluate our performance, and accordingly, our prospects must be considered in light of the risks that any new company encounters.

    <div class=' formc_margin30 formc-row'>
        We were incorporated under the laws of <%= @general_info.state %> on <%= date_format @general_info.date_formed %>. Accordingly, we have no history upon which an evaluation of our prospects and future performance can be made. Our proposed operations are subject to all business risks associated with new enterprises. The likelihood of our creation of a viable business must be considered in light of the problems, expenses, difficulties, complications, and delays frequently encountered in connection with the inception of a business, operation in a competitive industry, and the continued development of advertising, promotions, and a corresponding client base. We anticipate that our operating expenses will increase for the near future. There can be no assurances that we will ever operate profitably. You should consider the Company’s business, operations and prospects in light of the risks, expenses and challenges faced as an early-stage company.
    </div>

    <div class=' formc_margin30 formc-row bold_and_italic' style='font-style: italic;font-weight: bold;font-size: 13pt;'>We may face potential difficulties in obtaining capital.</div>
    <div class=' formc_margin30 formc-row '>We may have difficulty raising needed capital in the future as a result of, among other factors, our lack of an approved product and revenues from sales, as well as the inherent business risks associated with our company and present and future market conditions. Our business currently does not generate any sales and future sources of revenue may not be sufficient to meet our future capital requirements. We will require additional funds to execute our business strategy and conduct our operations. If adequate funds are unavailable, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our [research, development or commercialization programs, product launches or marketing efforts,] any of which may materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.</div>

        The Company’s success depends on the experience and skill of the board of directors, its executive officers and key employees.
    </div>
    <div class=' formc_margin30 formc-row '>
        In particular, the Company is dependent on <%= @general_info.officers.first.name %> who are CEO of the Company. The Company has or intends to enter into employment agreements with <%= @general_info.officers.first.name %> although there can be no assurance that it will do so or that they will continue to be employed by
        the Company for a particular period of time. The loss of any member of the board of directors or executive officer could harm the Company’s business, financial condition, cash flow and results of operations.

        The amount of capital the Company is attempting to raise in this offering is not enough to sustain the Company’s current business plan.
    </div>
    <div class=' formc_margin30 formc-row '>
        In order to achieve the Company’s near and long-term goals, the Company will need to procure funds in addition to the amount raised in the offering. There is no guarantee the Company will be able to raise such funds on acceptable terms or at all. If we are not able to raise sufficient capital in the future, we will not be able to execute our business plan, our continued operations will be in jeopardy and we may be forced to cease operations and sell or otherwise transfer all or substantially all of our remaining assets, which could cause a Purchaser to lose all or a portion of his or her investment.
    </div>
    <div class=' formc_margin30 formc-row bold_and_italic' style='font-style: italic;font-weight: bold;font-size: 13pt;'>
        Although dependent on certain key personnel, the Company does not have any key man life insurance policies on any such people.
    </div>
    <div class=' formc_margin30 formc-row '>
        The Company is dependent on <%= @general_info.officers.first.name %> in order to conduct its operations and execute its business plan, however, the Company has not purchased any insurance policies with respect to those individuals in the event of their death or disability. Therefore, in any of <%= @general_info.officers.first.name %> die or become disabled, the Company will not receive any compensation to assist with such person’s absence. The loss of such person could negatively affect the Company and its operations.

        We have not prepared any audited financial statements.

     <div class=' formc_margin30 formc-row bold_and_italic' style='font-style: italic;font-weight: bold;font-size: 13pt;'>
        Our earnings may decrease because of changes in prevailing interest rates.
    </div>
    <div class=' formc_margin30 formc-row '>
        Our profitability is directly affected by changes in prevailing interest rates. The following are certain material risks we face related to changes in prevailing interest rates:<br><br>

        *  an increase in prevailing interest rates could generate an increase in delinquency, default and foreclosure rates resulting in an increase in both operating expenses and interest expense and could cause a reduction in the value of our assets;<br>
        *   an increase in prevailing interest rates could adversely affect our loan originations volume because refinancing an existing loan would be less attractive for homeowners and qualifying for a purchase money loan may be more difficult for consumers;<br>
        *   an increase in prevailing interest rates would increase the cost of servicing our outstanding debt, including our ability to finance servicing advances and loan originations;<br>
        *  a decrease in prevailing interest rates may increase prepayment speeds causing our servicing fees to decline more rapidly than anticipated and we may record a decrease in the value of our MSRs;<br>
        *   a decrease in prevailing interest rates may lead to higher compensating interest expense and increased amortization expense as we revise downward our estimate of total expected income as prepayment speeds increase; and a decrease in prevailing interest rates could reduce our earnings from our custodial deposit accounts.<br>
    </div>



     <div class=' formc_margin30 formc-row bold_and_italic' style='font-style: italic;font-weight: bold;font-size: 13pt;'>
        Fluctuations in interest rates could negatively affect transaction volume.
    </div>
    <div class=' formc_margin30 formc-row '>
        All personal and nearly all small business loans facilitated through our marketplace are issued with fixed interest rates, and education and patient finance loans facilitated by our platform are issued with fixed or variable rates, depending on the type of loan. If interest rates rise, investors who have already committed capital may lose the opportunity to take advantage of the higher rates. Additionally, potential borrowers could seek to defer loans as they wait for interest rates to settle, and borrowers of variable rate loans through may be subject to increased interest rates. If interest rates decrease after a loan is made, borrowers through our marketplace may prepay their loans to take advantage of the lower rates. Investors through our marketplace would lose the opportunity to collect the above-market interest rate payable on the corresponding loan and may delay or reduce future loan investments. As a result, fluctuations in the interest rate environment may discourage investors and borrowers from participating in our marketplace and may reduce our loan originations, which may adversely affect our business.
    </div>

     <div class=' formc_margin30 formc-row bold_and_italic' style='font-style: italic;font-weight: bold;font-size: 13pt;'>
        Negative public opinion could damage our reputation and adversely affect our business.
    </div>
    <div class=' formc_margin30 formc-row '>
        Reputation risk, or the risk to our business from negative public opinion, is inherent in our business. Negative public opinion can result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including [lending and debt collection practices, corporate governance, and actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to those activities]. Negative public opinion can also result from media coverage, whether accurate or not. Negative public opinion can adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers and employees and can expose us to litigation and regulatory action.
    </div>


     <div class=' formc_margin30 formc-row bold_and_italic' style='font-style: italic;font-weight: bold;font-size: 13pt;'>
        Our business and operating results may be impacted by adverse economic conditions.
    </div>
    <div class=' formc_margin30 formc-row '>
        General economic  factors  and conditions in the  United States  or worldwide, including the general interest rate environment, unemployment rates and residential home values, may affect borrower willingness to seek loans and investor ability and desire to invest in  loans.  For example, during the 2008 financial crisis, banks severely constrained lending activities, which caused a decline in loan issuances. A similar crisis could negatively impact the willingness of investors and borrowers to participate on our marketplace. Although the U.S. and global economies have shown improvement, the recovery remains modest and uncertain. If present U.S. and global economic uncertainties persist, many of our investors may delay or reduce their investment in the loans facilitated through our marketplace. Adverse economic conditions could also reduce the number of individuals seeking to invest in loans facilitated on our marketplace, reduce the number of qualified borrowers seeking loans on our marketplace and result in borrowers being unable to make payments. Should any of these situations occur, our revenue and transactions on our marketplace would decline and our business would be negatively impacted.
    </div>

     <div class=' formc_margin30 formc-row bold_and_italic' style='font-style: italic;font-weight: bold;font-size: 13pt;'>
        If we do not respond to technological changes or upgrade our websites and technology systems, our growth prospects and results of operations could be adversely affected.
    </div>
    <div class=' formc_margin30 formc-row '>
        To remain competitive, we must continue to enhance and improve the functionality and features of our websites and technology infrastructure. As a result, we will need to continue to improve and expand our hosting and network infrastructure and related software capabilities. These improvements may require greater levels of spending than we have experienced in the past. Without such improvements, our operations might suffer from unanticipated system disruptions, slow application performance or unreliable service levels, any of which could negatively affect our reputation and ability to attract and retain customers and contributors. Furthermore, in order to continue to attract and retain new customers, we are likely to incur expenses in connection with continuously updating and improving our user interface and experience. We may face significant delays in introducing new services, products and enhancements. If competitors introduce new products and services using new technologies or if new industry standards and practices emerge, our existing websites and our proprietary technology and systems may become obsolete or less competitive, and our business may be harmed. In addition, the expansion and improvement of our systems and infrastructure may require us to commit substantial financial, operational and technical resources, with no assurance that our business will improve.

        We currently obtain components from single or limited sources, and are subject to significant supply and pricing risks.
    </div>
    <div class=' formc_margin30 formc-row '>
        Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. While the Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components, there can be no assurance that we will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. A number of suppliers of components may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting our ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components. The follow-on effects from global economic conditions on our suppliers, also could affect our ability to obtain components. Therefore, we remain subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases.<br><br>

        Our products often utilize custom components available from only one source. Continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected for any number of reasons, including if those suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet our requirements. The supply of components for a new or existing product could be delayed or constrained, or a key manufacturing vendor could delay shipments of completed products to us adversely affecting our business and results of operations.

        The SAFE (Simple Agreement for Future Equity) will not be freely tradable until one year from the initial purchase date. Although the SAFE (Simple Agreement for Future Equity) may be tradeable under federal securities law, state securities regulations may apply and each Purchaser should consult with his or her attorney.
    </div>
    <div class=' formc_margin30 formc-row '>
        You should be aware of the long-term nature of this investment. There is not now and likely will not be a public market for the SAFE (Simple Agreement for Future Equity). Because the SAFE (Simple Agreement for Future Equity) have not been registered under the Securities Act or under the securities laws of any state or non-United States jurisdiction, the SAFE (Simple Agreement for Future Equity) have transfer restrictions and cannot be resold in the United States except pursuant to Rule 501 of Regulation CF. It is not currently contemplated that registration under the Securities Act or other securities laws will be effected. Limitations on the transfer of the SAFE (Simple Agreement for Future Equity) may also adversely affect the price that you might be able to obtain for the SAFE (Simple Agreement for Future Equity) in a private sale. Purchasers should be aware of the long-term nature of their investment in the Company. Each Purchaser in this Offering will be required to represent that it is purchasing the Securities for its own account, for investment purposes and not with a view to resale or distribution thereof.

        Neither the Offering nor the Securities have been registered under federal or state securities laws, leading to an absence of certain regulation applicable to the Company.
    </div>
    <div class=' formc_margin30 formc-row '>
        No governmental agency has reviewed or passed upon this Offering, the Company or any Securities of the Company. The Company also has relied on exemptions from securities registration requirements under applicable state securities laws. Investors in the Company, therefore, will not receive any of the benefits that such registration would otherwise provide. Prospective investors must therefore assess the adequacy of disclosure and the fairness of the terms of this offering on their own or in conjunction with their personal advisors.

    <div class=' formc_margin30 formc-row '>
        There is no assurance that a Purchaser will realize a return on its investment or that it will not lose its entire investment.

    <div class=' formc_margin30 formc-row '>
        The Company may extend the Offering deadline beyond what is currently stated herein. This means that your investment may continue to be held in escrow while the Company attempts to raise the Minimum Amount even after the Offering deadline stated herein is reached. Your investment will not be accruing interest during this time and will simply be held until such time as the new Offering deadline is reached without the Company receiving the Minimum Amount, at which time it will be returned to you without interest or deduction, or the the Company receives the Minimum Amount, at which time it will be released to the Company to be used as set forth herein. Upon or shortly after release of such funds to the Company, the Securities will be issued and distributed to you.

        Purchasers will not have an ownership claim to the Company or to any of its assets or revenues for an indefinite amount of time, and depending on when and how the Securities are converted, the Purchasers may never become equity holders of the Company. Purchasers will not become equity holders of the Company unless the Company receives a future round of financing great enough to trigger a conversion and the Company elects to convert the Securities. The Company is under no obligation to convert the Securities into CF Shadow Securities (the type of equity securities Purchasers are entitled to receive upon such conversion). In certain instances, such as a sale of the Company, an IPO or a dissolution or bankruptcy, the Purchasers may only have a right to receive cash, to the extent available, rather than equity in the Company.

        Purchasers will not have the right to vote upon matters of the Company even if and when their Securities are converted into CF Shadow Securities. Upon such conversion, CF Shadow Securities will have no voting rights and even in circumstances where a statutory right to vote is provided by state law, the CF Shadow Security holders are required to vote with the majority of the security holders in the new round of equity financing upon which the Securities were converted. For example, if the Securities are converted upon a round offering Series B Preferred Shares, the Series B-CF Shadow Security holders will be required to vote the same way as a majority of the Series B Preferred Share holders vote. Thus, Purchasers will never be able to freely vote upon any director or other matters of the Company.

    <div class=' formc_margin30 formc-row '>
        Purchasers will not have the right to inspect the books and records of the Company or to receive financial or other information from the Company, other than as required by Regulation CF. Other security holders may have such rights. Regulation CF requires only the provision of an annual report on Form C-AR and no additional information. This lack of information could put Purchasers at a disadvantage in general and with respect to other security holders.

    <div class=' formc_margin30 formc-row '>
        In a dissolution or bankruptcy of the Company, Purchasers of Securities which have not been converted will be entitled to distributions as if they were common stock holders. This means that such Purchasers will be at the lowest level of priority and will only receive distributions once all creditors as well as holders of more senior securities, including any preferred stock holders, have been paid in full. If the Securities have been converted into CF Shadow Securities, the  Purchasers will have the same rights and preferences (other than the ability to vote) as the holders of the securities issued in the equity financing upon which the Securities were converted.

        Purchasers will be unable to declare the Security in “default” and demand repayment.
    </div>
    <div class=' formc_margin30 formc-row '>
        Purchasers will be able to demand repayment of their investment. The Company has ultimate discretion as to whether or not to convert the Securities upon a future equity financing and Purchasers have no right to demand such conversion. Only in limited circumstances, such as a liquidity event, may the Purchasers demand payment and even then, such payments will be limited to the amount of cash available to the Company.

     <div class=' formc_margin30 formc-row bold_and_italic' style='font-style: italic;font-weight: bold;font-size: 13pt;'>
        The Company may never elect to convert the Securities or undergo a liquidity event.
    </div>
    <div class=' formc_margin30 formc-row '>
        The Company may never receive a future equity financing or elect to convert the Securities upon such future financing. In addition, the Company may never undergo a liquidity event such as a sale of the Company or an IPO. If neither the conversion of the Securities nor a liquidity event occurs, the Purchasers could be left holding the Securities in perpetuity. The Securities have numerous transfer restrictions and will likely be highly illiquid, with no secondary market on which to sell them. The Securities are not equity interests, have no ownership rights, have no rights to the Company’s assets or profits and have no voting rights or ability to direct the Company or its actions.

        In addition to the risks listed above, businesses are often subject to risks not foreseen or fully appreciated by the management. It is not possible to foresee all risks that may affect us.<br>
        Moreover, the Company cannot predict whether the Company will successfully effectuate the Company’s current business plan. Each prospective Purchaser is encouraged to carefully analyze the risks and merits of an investment in the Securities and should take into consideration when making such analysis, among other, the Risk Factors discussed above.<br><br>

        The price of the Securities does not necessarily bear any relationship to the Company’s asset value, net worth, revenues or other established criteria of value, and should not be considered indicative of the actual value of the Securities.

        In order to purchase the Securities you must make a commitment to purchase by completing the Subscription Agreement. Purchaser funds will be held in escrow with <span style='background-color: yellow'>ABC Escrow Agent</span> until
        the Minimum Amount of investments is reached. Purchasers may cancel an investment commitment until 48 hours prior to the Offering Deadline or the Closing, whichever comes first using the cancellation mechanism provided by the Intermediary. The Company will notify Purchasers when the Minimum Amount has been reached. If the Company reaches the Minimum Amount prior to the Offering Deadline, it may close the Offering after five (5) days from reaching the Minimum Amount and providing notice to the Purchasers. If any material change (other than reaching the Minimum Amount) occurs related to the Offering prior to the Offering Deadline, the Company will provide notice to Purchasers and receive reconfirmations from Purchasers who have already made commitments. If a Purchaser does not reconfirm his or her investment commitment after a material change is made to the terms of the Offering, the Purchaser’s investment commitment will be cancelled and the committed funds will be returned without interest or deductions. If a Purchaser does not cancel an investment commitment before the Minimum Amount is reached, the funds will be released to the Company upon closing of the Offering and the Purchaser will receive the Securities in exchange for his or her investment. Any Purchaser funds received after the initial closing will be released to the Company upon a subsequent closing and the Purchaser will receive Securities via Electronic Certificate/PDF in exchange for his or her investment as soon as practicable thereafter.

        Upon each future equity financing of greater than $1,000,000.00 (an “Equity Financing”), the Securities are convertible at the option of the Company, into CF Shadow Series securities, which are securities identical to those issued in such future Equity Financing except 1) they do not have the right to vote on any matters except as required by law, 2) they must vote in accordance with the majority of the investors in such future Equity Financing with respect to any such required vote and 3) they are not entitled to any inspection or information rights (other than those contemplated by Regulation CF). The Company has no obligation to convert the Securities in  any future financing.

        Conversion Upon the First Equity Financing
    </div>

    <div class=' formc_margin30 formc-row '>
        If the Company elects to convert the Securities upon the first Equity Financing following the issuance of the Securities, the Purchaser will receive the number of CF Shadow Series securities equal to the greater of the quotient obtained by dividing the amount the Purchaser paid for the Securities (the “Purchase Amount”) by:<br><br>

        (a)       the quotient of $6,000,000.00 divided by the aggregate number of issued and outstanding shares of capital stock, assuming full conversion or exercise of all convertible and exercisable securities then outstanding, including shares of convertible preferred stock and all outstanding vested or unvested options or warrants to purchase capital stock, but excluding (i) the issuance of all shares of capital stock reserved and available for future issuance under any of the Company’s existing equity incentive plans, (ii) convertible promissory notes issued by the Company, (iii)  any Simple Agreements for Future Equity, including the Securities (collectively, “Safes”), and<br><br>
        (iv) any equity securities that are issuable upon conversion of any outstanding convertible promissory notes or Safes,<br><br>

        OR<br><br>

        (b)      the lowest price per share of the securities sold in such Equity Financing multiplied by 20.00%.<br><br>

        The price (either (a) or (b)) determined immediately above shall be deemed the “First Financing Price” and may be used to establish the conversion price of the Securities at a later date, even if the Company does not choose to convert the Securities upon the first Equity Financing following the issuance of the Securities.

    <div class=' formc_margin30 formc-row '>
        If the Company elects to convert the Securities upon an Equity Financing after the first Equity Financing following the issuance of the Securities, the Purchaser will receive the number of CF Shadow Series securities equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (a) the Purchase Amount by (b) the First Financing Price.

        Conversion Upon a Liquidity Event Prior to an Equity Financing
    </div>

    <div class=' formc_margin30 formc-row '>
        In the case of an initial public offering of the Company (“IPO”) or Change of Control (see below) (either of these events, a “Liquidity Event”) of the Company prior to any Equity Financing, the Purchaser will receive, at the option of the Purchaser, either (i) a cash payment equal to the Purchase Amount (subject to the following paragraph) or (ii) a number of shares of common stock of the Company equal to the Purchase Amount divided by the quotient of (a)
        <span style='background-color: yellow'>$$6,000,000.00</span> divided by (b) the number, as of immediately prior to the Liquidity Event, of shares of the Company’s capital stock (on an as-converted basis) outstanding, assuming exercise or conversion of all outstanding vested and unvested options, warrants and other convertible securities, but excluding: (i) shares of common stock reserved and available for future grant under any equity incentive or similar plan; (ii) any Safes; and (iii) convertible promissory notes.
    <br><br>
        In connection with a cash payment described in the preceding paragraph, the Purchase Amount will be due and payable by the Company to the Purchaser immediately prior to, or concurrent with, the consummation of the Liquidity Event. If there are not enough funds to pay the Purchasers and holders of other Safes (collectively, the “Cash-Out Investors”) in full, then all of the Company’s available funds will be distributed with equal priority and pro rata among the Cash-Out Investors in proportion to their Purchase Amounts.
        <br><br>
        “Change of Control” as used above and throughout this section, means (i) a transaction or transactions in which any person or group becomes the beneficial owner of more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities entitled to elect the Company’s board of directors, (ii) any reorganization, merger or consolidation of the Company, in which the outstanding voting security holders of the Company fail to retain at least a majority of such voting securities following such transaction(s) or (iii) a sale, lease or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company.

    </div>

    <div class=' formc_margin30 formc-row '>
        In the case of a Liquidity Event following any Equity Financing, the Purchaser will receive, at  the option of the Purchaser, either (i) a cash payment equal to the Purchase Amount (as described above) or (ii) a number of shares of the most recently issued preferred stock equal to the  Purchase Amount divided by the First Financing Price. Shares of preferred stock granted in connection therewith shall have the same liquidation rights and preferences as the shares of preferred stock issued in connection with the Company’s most recent Equity Financing.

    <div class=' formc_margin30 formc-row '>
        If there is a Dissolution Event (see below) before the Securities terminate, the Company will distribute, subject to the preferences applicable to any series of preferred stock then outstanding, all of its assets legally available for distribution with equal priority among the Purchasers, all holders of other Safes (on an as converted basis based on a valuation of common stock as determined in good faith by the Company’s board of directors at the time of the Dissolution Event) and all holders of common stock.
    <br><br>
        A “Dissolution Event” means (i) a voluntary termination of operations by the Company, (ii) a general assignment for the benefit of the Company’s creditors or (iii) any other liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company (excluding a Liquidity Event), whether voluntary or involuntary.
    </div>

    <div class=' formc_margin30 formc-row bold'>Termination</div>
    <div class=' formc_margin30 formc-row '>
    The Securities terminate upon (without relieving the Company of any obligations arising from a prior breach of or non-compliance with the Securities) upon the earlier to occur: (i) the issuance of shares in the CF Shadow Series to the Purchaser pursuant to the conversion provisions or (ii) the payment, or setting aside for payment, of amounts due to the Purchaser pursuant to a Liquidity Event or a Dissolution Event.

        Restrictions on Transfer

    <div class=' formc_margin30 formc-row '>
        The Securities being offered may not be transferred by any Purchaser of such Securities during the one-year holding period beginning when the Securities were issued, unless such Securities  are transferred: 1) to the Company, 2) to an accredited investor, as defined by Rule 501(d) of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act, 3) as part of an IPO or 4) to a member of the family of the Purchaser or the equivalent, to a trust controlled by the Purchaser, to a trust created for the benefit of a member of the family of the Purchaser or the equivalent, or in connection with the death or divorce of the Purchaser or other similar circumstances. "Member of the family" as used herein means a child, stepchild, grandchild, parent, stepparent, grandparent, spouse or spousal equivalent, sibling, mother/father/daughter/son/sister/brother-in-law, and includes adoptive relationships. Remember that although you may legally be able to transfer the Securities, you may not be able to find another party willing to purchase them.
        <br><br>
        In addition to the foregoing restrictions, prior to making any transfer of the Securities or any securities into which they are convertible, such transferring Purchaser must either make such transfer pursuant to an effective registration statement filed with the SEC or provide the Company with an opinion of counsel stating that a registration statement is not necessary to effect such transfer.
        <br><br>
        In addition, the Purchaser may not transfer the Securities or any securities into which they are convertible to any of the Company’s competitors, as determined by the Company in good faith.
        <br><br>
        Furthermore, upon the event of an IPO, the capital stock into which the Securities are converted will be subject to a lock-up period and may not be sold for up to 180 days following such IPO.

    <div class=' formc_margin30 formc-row '>
    - The Company does not have the right to repurchase the Securities.<br>
    - The Securities do not have a stated return or liquidation preference.<br>
    - The Company cannot determine if it currently has enough capital stock authorized to issue upon the conversion of the Securities, because the amount of capital stock to be issued is based on the occurrence of future events.
