          <h4 class= "question ">
            What is Equity Crowdfunding?
          </h4>

          <p class= "faq-answer">
            Equity crowdfunding has recently become the most efficient way to raise money from people all over the world. There are two main types of crowdfunding: Equity-based crowdfunding, in which investors receive equity ownership in the company, and donation-based crowdfunding, when individuals donate money to a project or company in exchange for perks, such as tickets or non-monetary rewards.

            Why We Started DreamFunded?
          </h4>

          <p class= "faq-answer">
            Lack of employee liquidity has become a huge problem in Silicon Valley, as the average time to IPO continues to rise.  In 2000, the average time to IPO for Silicon Valley tech companies was four years, but by 2014, that average time had grown to 11-years. The longer the time to IPO, the longer employees are prevented from cashing out on their equity shares. Meanwhile there is significant and growing demand on the part of investors to acquire employee shares of companies like Uber and Airbnb.

          <h4 class= "question  ">
            Why Now?
          </h4>

          <p class= "faq-answer">
            Upcoming statutory changes promise to have a significant impact on the equity crowdfunding landscape. Changes to the JOBS Act (Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act) will open up 97% of the U.S. market to investment by ordinary Americans, rather than restricting it to accredited investors. For the first time in over 83 years, the general public will be able to invest in private companies directly. The R.A.I.S.E Act (Reforming Access for Investments in Startup Enterprises Act), which will soon be signed into law, will allow employee shareholders to liquidate shares in private companies in as little as 90 days, rather than the 12-month holding period which has prevailed for more than a century. In this dynamic context, DreamFunded has been able to position itself adeptly to become, as CNBC says "Silicon Valley's first private tech stock market."

            How Are We Different From The Competition?
          </h4>

          <p class= "faq-answer">
            DreamFunded created a much needed platform for providing liquidity and investment access to pre-IPO employees and accredited investors. Private tech companies are delaying IPO in favor of later stage funding rounds, delaying returns for employees with equity and pushing out public investors. While Angel investing is rapidly increasing as a funding alternative for early stage companies, most investors, public and private, remain largely unable to access investments in pre-IPO companies. Investors want the organization, deal access and management capability of a venture fund without the large financial commitment and fees, together with the ability to pick and choose the investments that interest them. DreamFunded offers a solution to this for employees and investors looking for liquidity and access to pre-IPO investments.

            The Promise & Shortcomings of Crowdfunding:
          </h4>

          <p class= "faq-answer">
            While crowdfunding promises to offer a new way to raise capital for small companies, a host of challenges hamper existing crowdfunding models: How can crowdfunding enable employees to sell their shares despite company ROFR restrictions? Can an investor determine that pre-IPO shares are offered at a good price? How can one determine whether the pre-IPO company valuation is accurate? Can an investor avoid the risk of seed stage investing but still capitalize on private tech companies? How can investor who is not part of a VC firm access investments in top-tier companies?
          </p>

          <p class= "faq-answer">
            These are important questions, and DreamFunded has the answers. We form individual limited partnerships (LLC’s) for each investment, and with our unique liquidation process, DreamFunded can avoid company ROFR restrictions, which enables employee shareholders to liquidate their shares whenever they choose to do so. DreamFunded also carefully vets and selects each deal for our members, sometimes also investing its own management funds as an active investor. We pre-negotiate and sign all term sheets, and we administer the deal logistics, paperwork, and future reporting on behalf of our member investors.  Investments start as low as $3,000 with no upper limit.
