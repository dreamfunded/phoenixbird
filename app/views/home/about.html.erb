		<p class="paragraph indent">Manny Fernandez will never forget his first dream, to build a startup, and his second dream, to get funded. In his early entrepreneurial years, Fernandez spent countless hours seeking funding from investors, instead of focusing on his startup. Much later as an investor, he came to understand first hand how the majority of angel investors do not have access to quality startup investment opportunities.</p>

Kemp realized a gap in existing crowdfunding and a major opportunity to create a platform catering towards investors.</p>
