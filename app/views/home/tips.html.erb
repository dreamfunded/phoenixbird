                <li>Why Invest in Private, not Public Companies? </li>
                <p class='panel'>Private tech companies are going IPO later than ever before.  In the last tech boom in 2000, the average time for a private company to go IPO was 4 years.  Now that average time is 11 years.  This means that the biggest returns, which used to be earned in the public markets have now shifted to private. </p>

                <p class='panel'>
                    The Kauffman Foundation did a study on “Returns to Angel Investors in Groups”.  What they found is that successful angel investors are invested into a portfolio of at least 20 angel investments.  This spreads out risk and improves the chances of hitting a home run.

                    <li>Building a Strong Investment Portfolio </li>
                    <p class='panel'>
                        The Kauffman Foundation’s study on returns to angels in angel groups concluded that in order to be successful as an angel investor, you must be invested into 20 or more startup companies. It also found that it is better to invest low dollar amounts into more companies, than to put high dollar amounts into just a few.

                        <li>New Trend: push to later stage funding rounds </li>
                        <p class='panel'>In the last tech boom in 2000, the average time to IPO was 4 years. As of last year, the average time to IPO was 11. This trend in later stage funding rounds is placing tremendous strain on employees with equity in private, Pre-IPO companies. Trends are changing, but employee compensation, and liquidity has not changed. So the DreamFunded team created a marketplace so shareholders can privately sell their shares to our community of investors.</p>
